# Custom Routes Feature PR Readiness Assessment

## Issue Reference
- **Issue #160**: Add support for custom HTTP routes alongside MCP endpoints
- **Branch**: `jordanburke` 
- **Key Commits**: bb4dc8b, 36c5468, db75897 (August 14, 2025)

## Feature Overview
Implementation of custom HTTP route handling alongside MCP endpoints, enabling developers to build comprehensive HTTP services within the same server process.

## ‚úÖ Strengths - What's Ready

### 1. **Excellent Test Coverage**
- 20 comprehensive test cases in `src/FastMCP.routes.test.ts`
- All tests passing successfully
- Covers edge cases including authentication, public routes, wildcards, and error handling

### 2. **Proper TypeScript Support**
All required types are correctly exported:
- `FastMCPRequest<T>` - Enhanced request object with params, query, body parsing
- `FastMCPResponse` - Response object with helper methods
- `HTTPMethod` - Union type for all HTTP methods including OPTIONS
- `RouteHandler<T>` - Type-safe route handler function
- `RouteOptions` - Configuration for public/private routes

### 3. **Complete Documentation**
- README.md updated with comprehensive custom routes section
- Clear examples for REST APIs, webhooks, admin interfaces
- Public routes documentation added

### 4. **Working Example**
- `src/examples/custom-routes.ts` demonstrates real-world usage
- Shows REST API, webhook handling, admin dashboard
- Includes authentication and public route examples

### 5. **Feature Completeness**
- Support for all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS)
- Path parameters (`:param`) and wildcards (`*`)
- Query string and request body parsing (JSON/text)
- Public routes that bypass authentication
- Integration with existing authentication system
- Request size limits (10MB) with proper error handling
- Zero additional dependencies

### 6. **Code Quality**
- Follows existing FastMCP patterns
- Maintains backward compatibility
- Clean separation of concerns
- Proper error handling

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues to Address Before PR

### 1. **Package Name Change**
```diff
- "name": "fastmcp",
+ "name": "@jordanburke/fastmcp",  // REVERT THIS
```
The package name must remain `fastmcp` for the upstream PR.

### 2. **Version Bump**
```diff
- "version": "1.0.0",
+ "version": "3.15.200",  // REVERT THIS
```
Version changes should be handled by maintainers via semantic-release.

### 3. **Commit History**
Current branch has:
- Multiple commits with identical messages (36c5468 and db75897)
- Unrelated "Bump" commits
- Mixed features (CLAUDE.md addition)

These should be squashed into a single clean commit.

### 4. **Mixed Features**
The branch contains:
- Custom routes feature (target for this PR)
- CLAUDE.md addition (should be separate PR)
- Package rename/version changes (should not be included)

## üìã Recommended PR Preparation Steps

### Step 1: Create Clean Feature Branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/custom-http-routes upstream/main
```

### Step 2: Cherry-pick Custom Routes Commits
```bash
git cherry-pick bb4dc8b 36c5468 db75897
```

### Step 3: Fix package.json
Edit `package.json` to:
- Keep name as `fastmcp`
- Keep version as `1.0.0`  
- Keep the `src/examples/custom-routes.ts` addition in tsup.entry

### Step 4: Squash Commits
```bash
git rebase -i upstream/main
# Mark commits 36c5468 and db75897 as 'fixup'
# Keep bb4dc8b as the main commit with its excellent message
```

### Step 5: Verify Everything Works
```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm lint
pnpm test src/FastMCP.routes.test.ts
```

### Step 6: Create PR
Use the commit message from bb4dc8b which perfectly describes the feature:

```
feat: add custom HTTP route support for REST APIs and webhooks

Implements custom HTTP route handling alongside MCP endpoints, enabling
developers to build comprehensive HTTP services within the same server
process. This addresses the feature request from issue #160 for parity
with the Python FastMCP implementation.

Features:
- Support for all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)
- Path parameters (e.g., /users/:id) and wildcards (/api/*)
- Query string and request body parsing (JSON/text)
- Enhanced request/response objects with helper methods
- Integration with existing authentication system
- Request size limits (10MB) and proper error handling

Implementation:
- Added addRoute() method for registering custom routes
- Routes are processed before built-in endpoints (health, OAuth)
- Maintains full backward compatibility with existing MCP functionality
- Zero additional dependencies - uses only Node.js built-ins

Testing:
- Added comprehensive test suite (20 test cases)
- Includes example server demonstrating REST API, webhooks, and admin UI
- All existing tests continue to pass unchanged

This enables use cases like:
- Admin dashboards alongside MCP tools
- Webhook endpoints for GitHub/Slack integrations
- File upload/download endpoints
- REST APIs that complement MCP functionality
- Static file serving

Closes #160
```

## üéØ Final Assessment

**The custom routes feature is PRODUCTION-READY and HIGH-QUALITY.**

The implementation:
- ‚úÖ Perfectly addresses issue #160 requirements
- ‚úÖ Follows FastMCP coding standards and patterns
- ‚úÖ Has comprehensive test coverage
- ‚úÖ Is well-documented with practical examples
- ‚úÖ Maintains backward compatibility
- ‚úÖ Adds significant value to the framework

**Required cleanup is minimal** - just removing unrelated changes (package rename, version bump, CLAUDE.md) to create a focused PR that maintainers can easily review and merge.
